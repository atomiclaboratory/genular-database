# STRING Protein Links Downloader

This script automatically downloads and decompresses the `protein.links.v11.0.txt` file from the STRING database if it's not already present in the `./bulk` directory. It's designed to facilitate bioinformatics researchers and data scientists in obtaining the latest protein interaction data without manual intervention. By checking the file's presence before attempting a download, it conserves bandwidth and reduces redundant operations. Simply clone the repository and run the script to ensure your dataset is up-to-date.
